This repository demonstrates a common error in Python:  a RecursionError caused by improper handling of base cases in recursive functions. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` offers a corrected version. The error occurs when calling the factorial function with a negative input. The solution implements appropriate checks for negative inputs to avoid the infinite recursion. This example highlights the importance of carefully considering all possible inputs and ensuring the recursive function terminates correctly.
